    "Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen When the snow lay round about Deep and crisp and even Brightly shone the moon that night Though the frost was cruel When a poor man came in sight Gath'ring winter fuel 'Hither, page, and stand by me If thou know'st it, telling Yonder peasant, who is he?  Where and what his dwelling?' 'Sire, he lives a good league hence Underneath the mountain Right against the forest fence By Saint Agnes' fountain.' 'Bring me flesh and bring me wine Bring me pine logs hither Thou and I will see him dine When we bear him thither.' Page and monarch forth they went Forth they went together Through the rude wind's wild lament And the bitter weather 'Sire, the night is darker now And the wind blows stronger Fails my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer.' 'Mark my footsteps, my good page Tread thou in them boldly Thou shalt find the winter's rage Freeze thy blood less coldly.' In his master's steps he trod Where the snow lay dinted Heat was in the very sod Which the Saint had printed Therefore, Christian men, be sure Wealth or rank possessing Ye who now will bless the poor Shall yourselves find blessing".split(' '),
    "O little town of Bethlehem How still we see thee lie Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting Light The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight For Christ is born of Mary And gathered all above While mortals sleep, the angels keep Their watch of wondering love O morning stars together Proclaim the holy birth And praises sing to God the King And Peace to men on earth How silently, how silently The wondrous gift is given!  So God imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heaven.  No ear may hear His coming, But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive him still, The dear Christ enters in.  O holy Child of Bethlehem Descend to us, we pray Cast out our sin and enter in Be born to us today We hear the Christmas angels The great glad tidings tell O come to us, abide with us Our Lord Emmanuel".split(' '),
